<hr>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This section of <b><i>IP Mon </i>
</b>allows you to setup automatic backups of the <b><i>IP Mon system. </i></b>As 
you can see there are two types of backup, there is the <b>SQL Database Backup
</b>and there is the <b>Video Database Backup. </b>The SQL backup consists of 
all the variables that have been stored, as in the information that it has 
received from sensors or even changes to the user settings. The Video backup, 
backs up all video that has been captured.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Basically they both backup in the 
same way, simple select a path you wish the database to be saved too by clicking 
on the [Browse] button, then select the day of the week and the time of the day 
and then click on either [Set SQL Backup] or [Set Video Backup]. Your backups 
will take place weekly on the day(s) that you set it up too be backed up.</font></p>
