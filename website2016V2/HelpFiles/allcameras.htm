<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of <i><b>IP Mon's </b></i>main features is 
the ability to use IP based cameras to monitor a specific area. Not only does <b>
<i>IP Mon</i></b> store your video clips for reporting purposes, but it can also 
show you what the camera is seeing in real time. This page allows you to look at 
as many or as few cameras at a time.</font></p>
